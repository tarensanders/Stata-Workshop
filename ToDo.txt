Stuff I'm not sure where to put
    Copy table command in edit menu for getting tables out of Stata
    Label database, variable, data
    Basics of time series analysis - xtset etc

    Indicator and interaction variables (tabulate, gen())

Maybe not needed to cover
    weighting (frequency and sampling)
    Basic stats commands (regress, anova, t-tests)
        Maybe just show all of the commands that are available
    

Understanding your data
    
    List data
    Use the if command to limit list
    Use 'order' to change the order of the variables in the data editor, 'aorder' to set alphabetically.
    Sort based on a variable using 'sort' - some methods require sorted data
    Tabulating, two-way tabs
    Other descriptive statistics 
         correlations, covariances, means, confidence intervals
     

Working with Stata output
    Using the 'stored results' section in Stata help files
        r() to get specific values from summaries
        Use return list to get all of the results
        e() post estimations
        Use ereturn list for these values

Common tasks you'll want to do in Stata
    Dealing with missing data
        Open a dataset and remove some values
    Destring data (alternatively, 'real' command)

Graphing in Stata
    This is one place where the menu bar can be really helpful
    Example - scatter plot to look at cost vs mpg, by foreign
    Line, bar, etc
    Subplots and by


    Not sure I need to cover this
